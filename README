# StackExchange API

This repository contains my practice code for consuming the StackExchange API, focusing on StackOverflow.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how to interact with the StackExchange API, perform queries, and process responses.

## Usage

This project is a collection of scripts/examples showing how to call various endpoints of the StackExchange API. To run an example, simply execute the script from your terminal.

## Project Ideas 
    1. Tag Analyzer: This project involves creating a script to analyze the most popular tags on StackOverflow within a specified time frame. By identifying trending technologies or topics, users can gain insights into the current interests of the developer community. For example, if "Python" and "Machine Learning" are among the top tags, it indicates a high interest in these areas.

    2. Question Notification System: Develop a system that alerts users through various means (e.g., email, SMS, desktop notifications) when new questions tagged with their specified interests are posted. This enables users to stay informed about the latest questions in their areas of expertise, ensuring they never miss out on contributing to relevant discussions.

    3. StackOverflow CLI: This project aims to create a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies interacting with StackOverflow. Users will be able to search for questions, view answers, and even post comments or answers directly from their terminal. This project is an excellent opportunity to practice building user interfaces in a non-graphical environment, enhancing the user's ability to quickly access information without leaving the terminal.

    4. Educational Tool: Design an educational tool targeted at helping new programmers. This tool would fetch questions tagged as beginner-friendly from StackOverflow and present them alongside interactive coding challenges. By directly engaging with real-world problems and solutions, new programmers can improve their coding skills in a practical, hands-on manner.
